# simple_mvp_android

If created a simple login example using  MVP(Model, VIew, Presenter), it shows how to implement this architectural pattern. 

# Model
The model will act  as the provider of the data(credentials) we want to save

# View
The View will contain a reference to the presenter to call/use its methods every time there is an interface action

# Presenter
The presenter which is  responsible to act as the middle man between View and Model class will determine if the user credentials are valid or invalid.
